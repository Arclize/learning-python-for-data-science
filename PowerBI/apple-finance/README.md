# Apple Inc. – Leverage Ratios & Capital Structure (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This Power BI report measures **Apple’s leverage ratios** and **capital structure** using data sourced from Apple’s Investor Relations and SEC filings. The model focuses on debt, equity, cash & marketable securities, and derives standard solvency/leverage metrics suitable for MBA coursework and executive discussion.

> Data sources: Apple Investor Relations (10‑K/10‑Q), consolidated financial statements PDFs

## 🎯 Objectives
- Assemble a clean financial dataset (Debt, Equity, Assets, Cash/Marketable Securities) across fiscal periods.
- Calculate and visualize leverage ratios (Debt/Equity, Debt/Assets, Net Debt/EBITDA, Interest Coverage).
- Profile Apple’s capital structure (mix of debt vs. equity, cash buffers, marketable securities).
- Summarize insights in a paper and present findings to stakeholders

## 🔄 Refresh & Setup
1. Open `Apple_Leverage_CapitalStructure.pbix` in **Power BI Desktop**.
2. Go to **Transform Data** → update file/URL connectors for Apple IR PDFs/XBRL or your local extracts.
3. **Refresh** to load current periods; validate that totals tie to the filings.

## 📝 Assumptions & Footnotes
- Figures are **as reported** in Apple’s filings; where aggregations are made (e.g., Total Debt), definitions follow standard practice and are documented in the **Data Lineage** page.
- All amounts shown in **USD (billions)** unless otherwise indicated.
